HTTP Structured Headers
=======================

An implementation of the algorithms specified in [RFC8941]

Includes a copy of a simple Base32 library I wrote.

The linked `tests` submodule defines a standard corpus of cases against which
implementations like this can test.  See the [structured-header-tests repository][tests].

[RFC8941]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8941
[tests]: https://github.com/httpwg/structured-header-tests/
