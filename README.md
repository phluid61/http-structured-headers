HTTP Structured Headers
=======================

An implementation of the algorithms specified in [draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure]

Includes a copy of a simple Base32 library I wrote.

The linked `tests` submodule defines a standard corpus of cases against which
implementations like this can test.  See the [structured-header-tests repository][tests]
